<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I'm Matt.  I call myself a hacker & maker.  Why?  I love breaking things and making things.  I'm interested in technology, particularly the type that makes humans more free, soverign and secure.  I love open source software and Linux.  I am am curretly learning hacking, coding and web development.  My background was in the creative industires - music & film.  I still dabble in that area now and again.</p>

<p>As a composer and music producer I have worked with EMI and Universal Music working on a range of production music albums. Some of my work has been featured on Netflix(Meat-eater Series) and produced a viral song for the game "Piggy". I also have performed professionally in the past, some of the highlights include being on the bill with - The Basics, Claudio, Husky, The Black Sorrows, Bag Raiders, Yo La Tengo and, once, Bon Jovi. I also had an endorsement with Chicago based instrument manufacturer Lakland basses.</p>

<p>In my spare time I love doing woodworking, gardening and hiking in the woods.</p>
