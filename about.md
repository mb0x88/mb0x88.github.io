<p>I am moving into the technology sector and I am looking forward to applying my creative background into the technology world. 

As a composer and music producer I have worked with EMI and Universal Music working on a range of production music albums. Some of my work has been featured on Netflix(Meat-eater Series). I also have performed professionally in the past, some of the highlights include being on the bill with - The Basics, Claudio, Husky, The Black Sorrows, Bag Raiders, Yo La Tengo and, once, Bon Jovi. I also had an endorsement with Lakland basses.

In my spare time I love doing woodworking, gardening and hiking in the woods.</p>
