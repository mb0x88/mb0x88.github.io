description: Why Urbit is Cool.
---


Urbit can come off like a bit of a strange project.  And it is.

But that is why I find it interesting.  

Many of the reasons why Urbit revolve around the ownership of data and identity in modern computer systems.

What use is crypto if we store our keys, our data or our identity on other peoples computers?

My dream is that Urbit would eventually bbe a computer, running in your house, connecting with the web, in a censorship resistant way.  Thhe current internet doesn't really enable that, but I'm into dreaming, why not?

It's cool that you can play chess, peer to peer.  You can do encrypted messaging.  We are just beginning.

Urbit enables peer to peer interactions on the internet, without third parties.  It enables ownership of your identity online, and ownership of your data.

Maybe it's not perfect, but it's an interesting project worth checking out.
